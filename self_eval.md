# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I feel like, coming from no background in coding at all, I am making decent progress. I am understanding the concepts, though I admittedly still get a bit caught up on the execution. I know what I am trying to do, but I can't figure out how the code wants to be put in to acheive that goal. I do find a lot of pride when I finally do get the computer to output what I wanted it to. That probably is the fun part about coding, isn't it?

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

The use of methods can help simplify tasks, and help the process move quicker. Processes that often need repeating can be shortened drastically, saving time and effort.
